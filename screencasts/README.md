# Screencasts
The `.cast` files in this directory are generated from the `.asc` files.

(This can be done by simply by running them, or by running `make cast` from the root directory.)

They do however require:
 * [asciinema](https://asciinema.org)
 * [asciinema-rec_script](https://github.com/zechris/asciinema-rec_script)
